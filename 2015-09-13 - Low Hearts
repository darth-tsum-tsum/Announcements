**Low Hearts Warning List**

Here at TPG we have a minimum sending requirement of 10/day or 70/week. If you don't send the minimum, you will be added to this list, and issued a warning via PM. The logs used in the calculation of the average sends for these warnings are contributed by anonymous heart trackers from our group who have volunteered their time to help keep TPG a premier heart sending group.

For the week 2015/09/06 - 2015/09/12

ยง - discussed in TPG main chat. Using only return hearts is inconsistant. Placement on this list is procedural in nature.

* Daniel, Avg 70, but a few trackers received under 70.
* Yugo, Avg 71, but two trackers received under 70.
*Lez Avg 70, but one tracker received 68
*Sarah Avg 81, but one tracker received 67

*Special Warnings:
These warnings are for people who's average sending is over 70/week, however some of our trackers have received less than 70 from them. Please ensure that you send the minimum to each group member in the future.

As we offer a 70/week option, you will have one full week form Sunday to Saturday PDT (GMT-7) to dispute, find other members who can vouch for your sending, or meet the minimum sending requirements. If you unauthorize your game please make a comment on the deauth/vacation post so we can take it into account when we calculate your sends.

Reminder: per the guidelines "Sending 8 or less daily (56 per week) may result in you being asked to leave the group immediately."
