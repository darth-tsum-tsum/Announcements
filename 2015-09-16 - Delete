B has been removed from the group under the 8/day|56/week rule.

48 for last week and 0 for this week. No sends since last Thursday. 

Records from multiple people show B has not sent in the last few days and before that have sent lower amount of hearts.

B will need to reapply (new process coming soon) before being able to rejoin the group. 

We will be aggressively seeking out those who are not active in the group. If you have anyone you think needs closer attention, please PM or use the feedback form http://bit.ly/TPGFeedback

The integrity of the group depends on the admins and members helping to manage the group.
